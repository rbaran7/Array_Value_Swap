A fun and simple Node.js application that creates a user defined list of 10 items and swaps two of the values positions.

In order to run the program:

1. Have Node.js Installed (https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. Clone this repo to a new fresh directory.

3. From the projects base directory, in the terminal type: 
            
            node swap.js
            
Enjoy!
